 * Bootstrap file for the Qoder MCP command-line interface.
 *
 * For backwards-compatibility we temporarily delegate to the existing
 * monolithic implementation in the repository root (cli.js).  This allows us
 * to introduce the new folder-based architecture incrementally while keeping
 * the published entry-point stable.
 *
 * Going forward, individual commands will be moved into the `cli/commands`
 * sub-folder and wired up here via Commander, following the SOLID principles
 * for maintainability and scalability.
